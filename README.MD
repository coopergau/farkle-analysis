Starting with no initial points needed

What I have:
- roll probabilities 
    - talk about how the first analytical guesses were significantly off and moonte carlo sims revealed a much more accurate distribution of rolls

Plan to get:
1. expected value base on current turn points and dice to roll
2. get optimal base strategy
    - run basic simulation with no adapative strategy
    - compare to making choices based on ev table
3. gam theory strategies use 1v1 
    - compare comeback strategy and secure the win strategy against optimal base strategy
    - compare one level deeper vs optimal comeback or secure the win strategy
